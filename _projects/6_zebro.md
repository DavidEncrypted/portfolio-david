I am part of the Software Engineering team of [Lunar Zebro](https://zebro.space/). At Zebro we are trying to make the *first ever* moonrover made **entirely by students**.

## --- MISSION PROFILE ---
### DESTINATION
**THE MOON**

### LAUNCH
**NO EARLIER THAN 2025**

### MISSION DURATION
**14 EARTH DAYS**

### DISTANCE
**384,400 KM**

---

The rover is designed to piggyback on a private or national space agency’s Moon lander. Once on the Moon, the rover’s main objective is to survive the harsh lunar conditions for one lunar day (14 Earth days) and communicate its location and health directly back to Earth.

In the course of the lunar day, the rover will test its unique six-legged locomotion. After walking some distance it will take a unique picture of the lander and Earth. While walking, the rover shall avoid craters and boulders bigger than itself by using the onboard Semi-Autonomous Navigation System (SANS). At the end of the day, the rover will enter hibernation mode to face the -233°C lunar night. It will beacon when it wakes up, if ever.
