The final assignment of the course Autonomous Flight of Micro Air Vehicles, at the TU Delft, was structured as a competition. My collegues and I were given a consumer drone and were tasked to make it fly on it's own. At the aerospace faculty, there is a drone arena facility called the CyberZoo. The goal was to fly the drone as far as possible within 10 minutes, while navigating increasingly complex obstacles. 

Below is a video showing a few minutes of our attempt. The details of our method and the results can be viewed in the final report beneath the video or the pdf can be downloaded [here](/assets/pdf/AE4317_Report.pdf). The code for the convolutional neural network can be viewed [her](https://github.com/DavidEncrypted/bebop_cnn_obstacle_detection)
