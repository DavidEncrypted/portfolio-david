The final assignment of the course Autonomous Flight of Micro Air Vehicles, at the TU Delft, was structured as a competition. A few of my collegues and me were given an consumer drone and tasked to make it fly on it's own. At the aerospace faculty, there is a drone arena facility called the CyberZoo. The goal of the competition was to get the drone to fly as far as possible in 10 minutes. While, during these 10 minutes, the complexity of the obstacles in the CyberZoo is repeatedly increased. Below is a video showing a few minutes of our attempt. The details of our method and the results can be viewed in the final report beneath the video or the pdf can be downloaded [here](/assets/pdf/AE4317_Report.pdf)
