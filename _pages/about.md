In 2017 I graduated as a [Bachelor of Computer Science](/projects/1_bachelor_thesis/) from the University of Leiden. Since then, I have worked at the EO for a year as a Data Engineer but decided I wanted to do a Master about robotics. I finished the premaster and am now a student of the Robotics master at the Technical University of Delft.

In the mean time I did a [game jam with some friends](/projects/7_gamejam/) and [built a boat](/projects/5_vlot/). On the personal front, I moved in with my girlfriend and we just bought our first car!

In Januari I started my own ZZP company, *Nimble Engineering*, specializing in Back-End Cloud Engineering, and just landed the first client!

I am currently looking for an internship, related to my study, starting next September. My primary interest lies in autonomous drones, which is reflected in the projects below.
