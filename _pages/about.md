In 2017 I graduated from as a Bachelor of Computer Science from the University of Leiden. Since then, I have worked at the EO for a year as a Data Engineer, decided I wanted to do a Master about Robotics. I finished the premaster and am now a student at the Robotics master at the Technical University of Delft.

In the mean time I did a game jam with some friends, built a boat, am now living together with my girlfriend and we just bought our first car.
I also started my own ZZP company called *Nimble Engineering* which just got their first client!

I am now looking for an internship, related to my study, starting next September. My main interest is autonomous drones, as visible below, I have chosen courses and projects to reflect this.
